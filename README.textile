h1. run4

@run4@ is a tool which is so useful, I'm surprised that no one had written it yet
(that I could find).  @run4@ runs any command for only a specified period of
time.

h2. Installation

Since it is only a 100 line C file, I didn't bother to go the whole makefile
route.  Simply @gcc run4.c -o run4@ and do with it whatever you like :)

h2. (Very Simple) Examples

@# see the usage@
@run4 -h@

@# run tshark for only half an hour and stop@
@run4 30 minutes 'tshark -i eth0 -w sniff.pcap'@

@# run ping for a minute@
@run4 1 minutes 'ping google.com'@

h2. Motivation

As you can see from the examples above, I needed something for testing networks
which would run for a while and then stop.  Simply sending a packet count (the
-c option) to these tools was insufficient for my purposes.

I hope others will find it as useful as I have.

h2. Enjoy,
